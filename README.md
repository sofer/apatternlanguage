# A (draft) Pattern Language

This document provides a tentative language for running a classroom at Founders & Coders.

See [Christopher Alexander's book](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Ecological_Building/A_Pattern_Language.pdf).

## Classroom projects

### One week long 
Usually, a classroom project will last for five days.

### Planning and research on Monday
Gather information on the project and on the tools that you will be using. Create wireframes and user stories. 

### Tests on Tuesday
Before starting on writing code, write a full set of acceptance tests for your user stories. Create the file structure for your project. Write empty functions that represent your application logic and write failing tests. Get 100% code coverage.

### Code reviews on Friday morning
Start the last day of the project with code reviews.

## Classroom groups

### Groups of four
In a group of four, there are four combinations of three plus one, allowing a single group to rotate roles in a four-week period. In each week, the dynamic of the group will be different.

### Teams of three
The best size for a project team is probably three. In a team of three, it is harder for somebody to hide and there is a good possibility of fluidity in the way the team works. Three can pair program or two can pair and one can work alone in three combinations.

### Milk monitors
One week in four, every group member can take a week off from working on a project. Instead, they will take on a supervisory role in the classroom.

## Roles

### Repo owner

### Tester

### Timekeeper


## Paired programming

### Use one keyboard
If two people are using more than one keyboard, they are not pairing.

### Use a big screen
where one is available, use a big screen, so that each person can easily see what is going on.

### Use checklists
While beginners are getting used to code reviewing, they can use checklists to remind themselves of the questions they can ask when looking at somebody else's code.
